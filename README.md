## System Requirements

The project uses poetry for Python to create an isolated environment and manage package dependencies. To prepare your system, ensure you have an official distribution of Python version 3.7+ and install Poetry using one of the following commands (as instructed by the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#system-requirements)):

### Poetry installation (Bash)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python -
```

### Poetry installation (PowerShell)

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

## Dependencies

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from your preferred shell:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

You'll also need to clone a new `.env` file from the `.env.template` to store local configuration options. This is a one-time operation on first setup:

```bash
$ cp .env.template .env  # (first time only)
```

The `.env` file is used by flask to set environment variables when running `flask run`. This enables things like development mode (which also enables features like hot reloading when you make a file change).

## Data encryption

The app stores data in an Azure Cosmos DB instance. All databases and backups are therefore encrypted at rest. Further details can be found in the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/database-encryption-at-rest).

When setting up a Web App in Azure, it should also be ensured that:
- Encryption in-transit is enforced by configuring the settings to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- `ssl=true` is included as a query parameter in the CosmosDB connection string to ensure that traffic between the web app and DB is encrypted in-transit. 

## Secrets/Environment variables

To run the app locally you'll need to modify the values in the `.env` file. In particular you'll need to ensure you can connect to an Azure Cosmos DB instance by entering your `COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING` and `COSMOS_DB_NAME`. More information can be found in the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/connect-account)

***Remember to ensure that your .env file is listed in your .gitignore - never commit your API key or token to GitHub***

## Running the App Locally

Once the all dependencies have been installed, start the Flask app in development mode within the Poetry environment by running:
```bash
$ poetry run flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.

## Running the Tests

Tests can be found in the ```tests/``` directory. To run these tests from the terminal:
* Make sure you have pytest installed - if you have run ```poetry install``` then you should already have it as it's a dependency of the project.
* If you don't think you have pytest installed try running ```poetry add pytest --dev``` from the terminal
* Now to run the tests, you can stay in the terminal, navigate to the project root, and run ```poetry run pytest tests```. Here ```tests``` refers to the tests directory mentioned above, where all our tests are kept.
* If you want to run just one file of tests, you can be more specific: ```poetry run pytest tests/test_board.py```

If you want to add tests, be sure to conform to pytest standards and add them in a file that starts with ```test_``` or ends with ```_test``` and name any test function as ```test_<test_name>```.

## Running the App on a Virtual Machine

To run the app on a virtual machine(s):

1. Update the `todo_inventory` file to contain a list of the IP's of the virtual machines you want to run the app on.

2. Copy the files in the `ansible` directory to your control node. For example, using:

```bash
$ scp -r <relative_path_to_repo>/ansible/* <user>@<IP>:/home/<user>
```

3. Then ssh into that control node machine:

```bash
$ ssh <user>@<IP>
```

4. From here you should see all the files you've just copied across. You can run the app on all control nodes by running:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook todo_playbook.yml -i todo_inventory
```

5. You can check the app is running by visiting `http://<host-VM-IP>:5000` in a browser, replacing the <> section with each host IP address that you want to QC.

## Running the app in a Docker container

The app is set up to run in docker in development or production. You can also create an image to run the tests. In all the cases below `-it` can be replaced with `d` to run in detached mode.
 
### Development

Run:

    docker build --target development --tag todo-app:dev .

Then:

    docker run -it --env-file .env --publish 8081:5000 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/todo_app,target=/todo-app/todo_app todo-app:dev

### Production

Run:

    docker build --target production --tag todo-app:prod .

Then:

    docker run -it --env-file .env --publish 8081:8088 todo-app:prod

### Tests

Run:

    docker build --target tests --tag todo-app:test .

Then:

    docker run -it todo-app:test

## Deployment

### Manually deploying production Docker image

The Docker image produced by the `publish-docker-image.yml` file can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jackiew104/todo-app). This is the same image used in the Azure Web App.

When the container image has a new version, you can prompt the app to pull it and restart by following the steps below:
1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) navigate to the Deployment Center of the To Do Web App (<Resource Group> | <App Service> | Deployment Center).
2. Copy the `Webhook URL`.
3. In a terminal, run the command below, ensuring that you first _escape the `$` in the webhook_ using a backslash.
    ```
    curl -dH -X POST "<webhook>"
    ```

### Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is configured from the file at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. This includes steps to deploy the webapp and necessary infrastructure when changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

#### Provisioning infrastructure
The necessary Azure infrastructure is defined in the `main.tf` terraform file. This includes: 
- an App Service Plan;
- the Azure WebApp;
- and a CosmosDB account and Mongo database.

Terraform state is stored in a manually provisioned storage container in the resource group.

#### Code deployment
As described in the Manual section above, the webhook can be called automatically to deploy the code to Azure. Since the webhook URL has the potential to change as different infrastructure is provisioned, it is outputted automatically from the `terraform apply` step in the pipeline (as instructed in `outputs.tf`). This webhook is then used for the pipeline to initiate the deployment from a Docker image.

## Live site

The site is hosted on Azure, and should be updated/redeployed when changes are pushed to `master`. The site can be found [here](https://dev-terraformed-jsw-todo-app.azurewebsites.net/).

## Logs

Logs for all environments are outputted to [Loggly](https://jswtodoapp.loggly.com/). To log to the console - e.g. for development/debugging - use `logging.getLogger("todo_app")` or replace `"todo_app"` with the root `__name__` of the Flask app. Alternatively, just using `logging` should default to this logger.
